## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Today, more than 50% of News Agencies have Drones Team that performs the coverage of ‘live’ events. Typically these events do not have the luxury of having retakes, hence multiple drones are required for taking multiple vantage points at the same time. A large amount of expertise and coordination required and thus there is a need for Autonomous Flight Formation for multiple drones that can assist the human operators.

This project sets out to explore Reinforcement Learning based approaches to solve Real-time online inference drone flight in formation while tracking target using Camera and GPS sensors. Through the use of calibrated setup of a single target drone with multiple follower drones, the team explores the the effectiveness of Single Multi-Inputs Agent Reinforcement Learning vs Multiple Single-Input Agents Reinforcement Learning. The team demonstrated the results of the models trained in a pre-recorded simulation video and then presented their findings and observations in the accompanied report.

## SECTION 4 : USAGE GUIDE

### (A) System Requirements
1. OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS or Windows 10 + Windows Subsystem for Linux 1
2. Python: 3.6.7 (Anaconda or Miniconda distribution preferred)
3. Microsoft AirSim (v1.2.2 on Windows 10 or 1.2.0 on Ubuntu)
4. GPU (Discrete GPU preferred for running environment, playing simulations and training)
5. For Ubuntu Setup:
   - Docker
   - nvidia-docker
6. For cloud training:
    - Google Cloud Platform

### (B) Downloading Code
1. Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/raymondng76/IRS-Practice-Module-Dev.git`
2. Change Directory: `cd IRS-Practice-Module-Dev`
3. Follow further instructions below

### (C) AirSim Environment Install/Run

#### Windows 10
1. Download and unzip your preferred environment from the [AirSim release 1.2.2 page](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/releases/tag/v.1.2.2)
2. Run the AirSim environment by double-clicking on `run.bat`

#### AirSim docker on Ubuntu 18.04
1. Please refer to [airsim_docker_local_install_readme.md](airsim_docker_local_install_readme.md) for details on install

### (D) Python Environment and Dependencies
1. Create new conda environment: `conda create -n airsim python=3.6.7`
2. Switch environment: `conda activate airsim`
3. Install dependencies
   - Using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### (E) Loading of Model Weights
1. Download and copy YOLOv3 model weights to `IRS-Practice-Module-Dev` main directory
    - `unzip yolo_drone_weights.zip -d IRS-Practice-Module-Dev/`
    - `cd IRS-Practice-Module-Dev`
    - `mv Yolov3\ Drone\ Weights/ weights`
2. Download and copy RL model weights to `IRS-Practice-Module-Dev/code` sub-directory
